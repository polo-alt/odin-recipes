            DIRECTIONS
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a non stick pan, sweat onions over medium heat. Add crushed
            crushed garlic and ground beef until well browned.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with
            your favorite seasoning. Let it come to a boil then reduce heat
            to simmer for about 1-1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. While preheating, combine ricotta
            cheese with egg, 1/4 cup parmesan, and salt to taste.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble: spread meat sauce at the bottom of a square baking dish.
            Layer lasagna sheets over the meat sauce, enough to cover. Sread 
            ricotta mixture then place mozarella slices on top. Spoon meat sauce
            over the ricotta and cheese slices, sprinkle with grated parmesan. 
            Repeat layers and finish off the top with remaining mozza and parm cheeses.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and 
            bake for an additional 25 minutes. Serve warm or cool.
